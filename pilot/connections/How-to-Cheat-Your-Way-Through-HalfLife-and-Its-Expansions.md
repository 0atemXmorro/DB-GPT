## Activating the Cheat Mode
 
The cheat mode in Half-Life and its expansions is activated in a similar way. You need to edit the shortcut you use to access the game so that it reads something like this:
 `C:\Sierra\Half-Life\hl.exe -console +sv_cheats 1 -game valve` 
The `-console` option enables the console, where you can enter the cheat commands. The `+sv_cheats 1` option enables the cheat mode. The `-game` option specifies which game you want to play. For Half-Life, use `-game valve`. For Blue Shift, use `-game bshift`. For Opposing Force, use `-game gearbox`. You may need to replace `C:\Sierra\Half-Life` with the appropriate path if you installed the game in a different location.
 
Once you have edited the shortcut, launch the game and press <kbd>~</kbd> to open the console. You can now enter any cheat command you want. To close the console, press <kbd>~</kbd> again.
