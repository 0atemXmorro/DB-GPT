The Juno 60 is a six-voice polyphonic synthesizer with one digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) per voice. It has a 61-key keyboard with no velocity or aftertouch sensitivity. It offers a variety of waveforms to choose from, including pulse, sawtooth and square. The pulse width can be modulated by the LFO or the envelope generator. The DCO can also be detuned slightly for a thicker sound.
 
The filter section consists of a 24dB/octave low-pass filter with resonance and a non-resonant high-pass filter. The filter cutoff can be modulated by the LFO, the envelope generator or the keyboard tracking. The filter also has a switchable high-pass filter voicing that can be set to either Juno-60 or Juno-106 mode, giving more flexibility to the sound shaping. The envelope generator has four stages: attack, decay, sustain and release. It can be used to control the filter cutoff or the amplifier level.
 
The LFO section has a single triangle wave LFO that can modulate the DCO pitch, pulse width or filter cutoff. It has a manual trigger button that can restart the LFO cycle at any time. The LFO rate can be synced to the arpeggiator clock or an external MIDI clock. The arpeggiator section has an up/down mode and a hold function that can sustain the notes indefinitely. The arpeggiator can also be synced to an external MIDI clock.
 
The effects section includes a lush chorus effect that can add width and depth to the sound. It has two modes: I and II, with different modulation rates and depths. The chorus effect is one of the most distinctive features of the Juno-60 sound. The effects section also includes a classic CE-1 chorus ensemble effect, a reverb, a flanger, a tempo delay and an overdrive effect that can add some grit and warmth to the sound.
